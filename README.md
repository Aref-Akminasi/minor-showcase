# minor-showcase

I made this project during my 'Visual Design & Front-End Development' minor at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. This was part of my Communication & Multi-media Design course.

Together with my classmates, we made a town to display our projects from the minor. I focused on the coding, while my classmates created the designs for the apartments and buildings.
